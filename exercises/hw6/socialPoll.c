/*
Social  media  is  enabling  more  people  to  become  connected,  join  a  cause,  voice  opinions,  and  so  on.  The  U.S.  
presidential candidates in 2020 are using it intensively to get out their messages and raise money for their campaigns.
In this exercise, youâ€™ll write a simple polling program that allows users to rate the social-consciousness issues from 1 (least important) 
to 10 (most important). 
Pick seven causes that are important to you (e.g., political issues, global environmental issues, social
issue, etc.).   
Use a one-dimensional arraytopics(of typechar *) to store the seven causes. 
To summarize the survey responses, 
use a 7-row, 10-column two-dimensional array responses (of type int), where intuitively each row corresponds to an element in  
the topics array. When the program runs, it  should ask the user to rate each issue. 
Have your friends and family respond to the survey. Then have the program display a summary of the results, including:
a)  A tabular report with the seven topics down the left side and the 10 
    ratings across the top, listing in each column the number of ratings 
    received for each topic.
    
b)  To the right of each row, show the average of the ratings for that issue. 
c)  Which issue received the highest point total? Display both the issue and 
    the point total.
    
d)  Which issue received the lowest point total? Display 
    both the issue and the point total.
    
e)  Display the ranking of issues from highest to lowest 
    point total (along with the corresponding issue). 
    
f)  Using (only) the entries from the table, display the 
    number of people who responded.
